# Observations and Resolutions

## Testing and Coverage
N/A

## Architecture
No environment setup steps or how to run :(

## Code Cleanliness
Trailing Commas at the end of objects are everywhere. Shouldn't the linter catch these?

```
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    paddingTop: 64,
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    backgroundColor: clrs.white,
  },
  searchBox: {
    height: 40,
    borderColor: clrs.black,
    borderWidth: 2,
    margin: 16,
    paddingLeft: 10,
    fontWeight: '800',
  },
  mediaObject: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
    flexDirection: 'row',
    marginBottom: 10,
  },
```

Might want to pull out `class SpotifyArtistLookup` from index.js.
index.js seems to be handling the bootstrapping of the project while `class SpotifyArtistLookup` seems to be addressing the routing or initial load.

Artist.js and NavigationBar.js don't feel like components (they don't extend the components class at the very least). Maybe they belong in another category/folder? (Views?)

FadeInView also feels like helper component if that makes sense. It helps augment the ListItem component by fading it in. Maybe another seperate category/folder?

Shouldn't ios and android folders be in the .gitignore file?
